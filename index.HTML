    <h3>ABOUT C LANGUAGE</h3>
<P>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

    In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
    
    The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons −
    
    Easy to learn
    Structured language
    It produces efficient programs
    It can handle low-level activities
    It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms
    Facts about C
    C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
    
    C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
    
    The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
    
    The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
    
    Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
    
    Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
    
    Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
    
    Why use C?
    C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be −
    
    Operating Systems
    Language Compilers
    Assemblers
    Text Editors
    Print Spoolers
    Network Drivers
    Modern Programs
    Databases
    Language Interpreters
    Utilities
    C Programs
    A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
    
    This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</P>

<h3>BASIC KNOWLDGE ABOUT PYTHON</h3>
<p>Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:

    Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
    Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
    Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. ...</p></div>
